## About it
BronyCenter is a social network created mainly for My Little Pony fans. It's
currently in an early development stage, so a lot of things will change with time.

It's not recommended to use this code as it can have a lot of security issues. It
also doesn't have an installer or updater, so it may be hard to add new
changes to the database to update the code.

I know that I should use a MVC framework, but it takes me too much time to
learn it and I don't really know what's happening in my code then. Anyway, I try
to make my code as much readable as I can.
